"""System-prompt addendum + integration entry point for the workflows feature.

Behavioral guidance for the workflow tools is owned by the engine, not
by the agent markdown (see ``docs/workflows.md`` / "DX split"). When an
agent enables workflows in its frontmatter, the framework appends a
short addendum below to the agent's system prompt — covering both
*when* to reach for a workflow and *which* tools the workflow can call —
so every workflow-enabled agent gets the same heuristics without the
author having to copy-paste prose into every agent file.

``build_workflow_integration`` is the one call the app factory makes
to turn on workflows for the main agent: it registers the Durable
engine on the app, computes the effective tool allowlist for this app
from the optional ``workflows.allowed_tools`` frontmatter list, stashes
it on the workflows registry for ``start_workflow`` to read, and
returns the tool list + addendum the chat handlers should thread
through to the agent loop.

    - ``workflows`` set to a non-mapping (e.g. a string)
    - typo'd or unsupported key inside the block (e.g. ``enabld``,
      ``backend``, ``task_hub``). The latter two name real Durable
      concepts but are *not* honored by the library: Durable backend
      selection lives in ``host.json``'s
      ``extensions.durableTask.storageProvider`` block and task-hub
      naming lives in ``extensions.durableTask.hubName``. Silent
      acceptance would mislead a contributor into thinking frontmatter
      drives behavior it doesn't.
    - non-boolean ``enabled`` (``enabled: "false"`` is a YAML
      foot-gun — without this guard it would parse as truthy and
      enable workflows).
    - malformed ``allowed_tools`` (e.g. a string instead of a list,
      or a list with an empty string). Validated here so a
      ``allowed_tools`` typo surfaces even when the agent currently
