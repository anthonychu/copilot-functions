"""Agent-facing workflow tools (M1 step 2c).

Four tools:

- ``start_workflow`` — validate + start a workflow; return ``{"workflow_id"}``.
- ``get_workflow_status`` — return the status envelope for a workflow.
- ``list_workflows`` — list this session's recent workflows.
- ``terminate_workflow`` — hard-stop a workflow; no cooperative cleanup.

All four call the Durable client directly via the per-session registry
populated by the chat handler's ``durable_client_input`` binding.
Ownership is enforced by prefix-matching the Durable instance ID
against ``sha256(session_id)[:12]``; a mismatch returns 404 (same shape
as "not found") to avoid leaking existence of other sessions'
workflows. Cooperative ``cancel_workflow`` lands with the fan-out
orchestrator changes (it needs ``wait_for_external_event`` plumbing on
the orchestrator side).
