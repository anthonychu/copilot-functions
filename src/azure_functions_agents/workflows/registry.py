"""Workflow-safe tool registry (M1 step 3c).

Neutral home for the registry of tools the workflow orchestrator can
dispatch via its activity. Sits between :mod:`.engine` (which looks up
handlers at activity-execution time) and :mod:`.integration` (which
turns frontmatter into the effective allowlist + addendum) so neither
has to import the other.

Three concepts kept distinct:

- **Registered**: known to the engine, dispatchable. Name → handler +
  description + ``public`` flag.
- **Public**: included in the default allowlist when a frontmatter
  ``workflows.allowed_tools`` is not specified. Internal helpers like
  ``__echo`` are registered with ``public=False`` so they don't leak
  into agent-visible plans by accident.
- **Effective allowlist**: the set the running app actually permits in
  plans. Computed by :mod:`.integration` per-app and stashed via
  :func:`set_app_config`; read by ``start_workflow`` when validating
  a plan.

Reserved names (the LLM-facing workflow-management tools themselves)
can never be registered — workflow nodes must never reach back into
the workflow control plane.
