.SYNOPSIS
    Pre-flight check + narration for the workflow-incident-triage demo.

.DESCRIPTION
    Verifies that Azurite, the Durable backend, the Functions host, and
    the workflow tools are reachable, then walks the presenter through
    the stakeholder demo one step at a time. The script auto-detects
    whether the sample is currently configured for Azure Storage or
    Durable Task Scheduler (DTS) by inspecting host.json, and adapts
    pre-flight + narration accordingly. The script is interactive
    (pauses between steps) and does NOT drive the chat UI itself —
    pasting the prompt and watching the live-progress card is
    intentionally a manual step so the audience sees the agent author
    the plan in real time.

    This is a presenter aid, not a test. Functional validation lives in
    the pytest suite under ``tests/``.

.PARAMETER BaseUrl
    Base URL of the running Functions host. Defaults to
    http://localhost:7071.

.PARAMETER NoBrowser
    Skip auto-opening the chat UI in the default browser.

.PARAMETER SkipPause
    Run all steps without waiting for Enter between them. Useful when
    rehearsing or when re-running pre-flight only.

.EXAMPLE
    ./demo.ps1
    Run the full demo dry-run with default settings.

.EXAMPLE
    ./demo.ps1 -BaseUrl http://localhost:7071 -NoBrowser
    Pre-flight + narration only; do not open a browser.

Within a few seconds the agent should call start_workflow and a card
should appear in the chat thread. Things to point out:

  * Five tasks: fetch_logs, fetch_metrics, fetch_deploys, cooldown (wait),
    summarize_findings.
  * The three fetches transition to 'running' immediately and 'completed'
    in roughly the same wave — that is real Durable fan-out, not a
    sequential loop.
  * The cooldown wait sits at 'running' for ~30s. This is a durable
    timer: if you killed func.exe right now and restarted it, the timer
    would resume and the workflow would still complete.

if ($activeBackend -eq "dts") {
    Write-Step -Title (Next-StepLabel "open the operator dashboard (DTS only)") -Body @"
While the workflow is still running, open the DTS dashboard in a second
browser tab:

  $DtsDashboardUrl

You should see the same orchestration listed under task hub 'default'
(or whatever TASKHUB_NAME you set). Click into it and point out:

  * The execution history — every activity invocation, timer fired, and
    output payload, captured by the scheduler. This is the operator
    surface that the chat UI doesn't expose.
  * The instance is identical whether the agent or a human kicked it off,
    so on-call tooling and the chat experience converge on the same
    backing store.

This is the M2 headline: the same workflow you saw in chat is also a
first-class object in the operator's world. Same status envelope is
available programmatically via get_workflow_status — the dashboard
isn't doing anything the API can't do, it's just an out-of-the-box
view.
"@
    Pause-If-Interactive
}

Write-Step -Title (Next-StepLabel "terminal state and auto-notification") -Body @"
Around the 35-second mark the card should flip to 'Completed'. A
moment later, the chat UI will auto-inject a synthetic user message
labeled 'Automatic workflow notification' (subtle styling, expandable
to show the raw injected prompt). That message tells the agent the
workflow finished; the agent calls get_workflow_status once and
writes a short natural-language summary inline as a normal Copilot
turn — closing the loop without you typing anything.

Things to call out for stakeholders:

  * Fire-and-forget loop: the agent ended its turn after
    start_workflow returned. It did not poll. It only re-engaged
    because the chat client posted the synthetic notification on
    completion.
  * Token cost: the agent only sees the FINAL summary envelope (one
    get_workflow_status call), not every per-task output, because
    templating happens inside the orchestrator. This is
    Anthropic-style programmatic tool calling with durability.
  * Observability: the same status envelope the UI polls is also
    available outside the chat via get_workflow_status — operator
    dashboards, on-call tooling, and MCP Tasks clients all read the
    same shape.

Write-Step -Title (Next-StepLabel "(optional) demo cooperative cancel") -Body @"
If you have time, run the demo a second time and during the 30-second
wait, send a follow-up message:

  actually cancel that

The agent should call cancel_workflow. The orchestration unwinds at the
next wave boundary, the live card flips to 'Canceled', and partial
results gathered before the cancel are still visible. The auto-
notification then fires, prompting the agent to acknowledge the
cancellation in a final turn. Contrast this with terminate_workflow,
which stops abruptly; the auto-notification still fires (the chat UI
sees the terminal state regardless of cooperativity), and the agent
will say plainly that no usable result is available.
